# BlackBoxAgent — Intelligent Diagnostic Agent for Windows
A lightweight, self-governing diagnostic tool that monitors device health, detects issues, logs intelligently, and notifies IT in real-time.

## Summary for Investors and Enterprise Buyers
BlackBoxAgent is not just a script — it's a future-ready agent designed for scalable IT support environments. It silently monitors endpoint health, reduces MTTR, and pre-qualifies issues before human escalation.

## Key Features (Completed in Phase 1)
- Time-based scans every 8 hours (autonomous)
- Event-based triggers: VPN drop, DNS failure, interface disconnect
- Structured logging in local SQLite database (LightDB)
- Smart alerting via Email and Microsoft Teams
- Fully dynamic supervisor loop — no user config or manual triggering required
- Modular architecture for future extensions
## Project Architecture
- Folders: core/, db/, tools/, rules/, checks/
- Key Modules:
  - scan.py
  - triggers.py
  - supervisor.py
  - notifier.py
  - checks/ (wifi, vpn, dns, interface)
Include a sample system flow diagram if available.

## Upcoming Roadmap (Business-Oriented)
- Phase 2: Configurable scan policies, cloud-based log aggregation, centralized web reporting
- Phase 3: Live dashboard interface, user behavior analytics, adaptive scan logic (AI-backed)
- Phase 4: Enterprise deployment model (MSP Mode), multi-endpoint coordination
- Phase 5: SaaS monitoring portal with tiered billing, webhook integrations, and device control APIs
## Business Value and Use Case
- Designed for IT providers, MSPs, and internal support teams
- Prevents costly downtime by catching silent network and system failures
- Reduces human triage time by pre-tagging root-cause data
- Self-contained (no server dependency), making it ideal for remote or offline-first environments
## Getting Started (For Developers)
- Clone the repo
- Run python core/supervisor.py to activate full monitoring
- DB is auto-generated and logs go to db/lightdb.sqlite
- Use tools/view_logs.py to inspect results
